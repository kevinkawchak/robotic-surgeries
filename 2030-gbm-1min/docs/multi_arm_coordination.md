# Multi-Arm Coordination Protocol

This file fixes the inter-arm coordination protocol for the four-arm Medtronic NeuroSpeed 1.0 in the 1-minute variant. The control loop must implement the heartbeat, the cross-arm safety zone gating, the cumulative force limit enforcement, and the heartbeat-failure auto-park behavior described below.

## Heartbeat

All 4 arms exchange a 32-byte status frame at 1 kHz over a deterministic real-time bus. The bus is logically a single broadcast channel; physically it can be EtherCAT, TSN Ethernet, or a CAN-FD ring. The simulation uses a logical broadcast queue.

Each 32-byte frame carries:

- arm_id enum (1 byte)
- tick_us little-endian uint32 (4 bytes)
- ee_x, ee_y, ee_z little-endian float32 (12 bytes)
- ee_force_magnitude little-endian float32 (4 bytes)
- safety_zone enum (1 byte)
- robot_state enum (1 byte)
- heartbeat_seq little-endian uint32 (4 bytes)
- crc32 little-endian uint32 (4 bytes)
- reserved (1 byte)

Each arm transmits its own frame at 1 kHz. Each arm receives the other 3 arms' frames at 1 kHz. The frame deadline is 1 ms from transmission to receipt at all 3 sibling arms.

## Cross-Arm Safety Zone Gating

If any arm enters the FORBIDDEN safety zone, all 4 arms emergency-park within 5 ms. The 5 ms budget breaks down as:

- 1 ms heartbeat frame transmission to all 3 sibling arms.
- 1 ms per-arm trajectory replanning to the nearest safe park position.
- 2 ms per-arm motion to the safe park position at maximum braking deceleration.
- 1 ms per-arm settling and force re-zeroing.

The trigger condition is any single frame reporting safety_zone equals FORBIDDEN from any arm. The trigger is broadcast to the other 3 arms by setting heartbeat_ok = 0 in their next outgoing frame and by raising the local estop_state to 1.

## Tool Changeover

Tool changeover is not used in 1-minute resection. All four arms are assigned their tools during the precomputed pre-op window and do not change tools during the 60-second procedure.

## Force Sharing

Cumulative tip force across all 4 arms must remain under 12 N on the patient frame. Per-arm tip force limit is 5.0 N. The mathematical relationship is sum over arm = 1 to 4 of arm_force_magnitude must remain less than or equal to 12 N at every tick. Note that 4 times 5.0 N equals 20 N exceeds the 12 N cumulative cap; the protocol therefore enforces the cumulative cap in addition to the per-arm cap.

The cumulative force is computed at 10 kHz from the per-arm 10 kHz force samples. If the cumulative exceeds 11.0 N (a 1.0 N margin below the 12 N cap), each arm receives a clamp_to_force_share command that reduces its commanded velocity proportionally to its current contribution. If the cumulative still exceeds 12 N at the next tick, all 4 arms emergency-park per the cross-arm safety zone gating above.

## Communication Failure

If heartbeat is missed for 3 consecutive frames (3 ms), emergency-park triggers automatically. The miss detection is implemented per arm as a watchdog timer that resets on each successfully received heartbeat from each sibling arm. When the watchdog timer for any sibling exceeds 3 ms the local arm sets heartbeat_ok = 0 in its next outgoing frame and initiates the emergency-park sequence.

## Per-Arm Workspace and Collision Avoidance

The four arms share a 0.5 m radius hemisphere workspace centered on the surgical target. Each arm has its own preferred working sector that the trajectory planner enforces:

- Arm 1: front sector facing the surgeon (0 to 90 degrees azimuth from patient anterior).
- Arm 2: front-right sector (270 to 360 degrees azimuth).
- Arm 3: back sector (90 to 270 degrees azimuth, lower hemisphere only).
- Arm 4: top sector (upper hemisphere, facing the iMRI bore).

Inter-arm collision is prevented by a per-tick distance check between each pair of end-effector positions. The minimum allowed inter-arm distance is 8 mm (a 1 mm safety margin above the 7 mm physical clearance between the tool housings). If any pair of end-effector positions falls below 8 mm, the trailing arm pauses and the leading arm continues.

## Emergency Arm-Park Trigger Latency

The 100 microsecond emergency arm-park trigger latency is measured from the moment a triggering condition is detected by any arm to the moment all 4 arms have set their commanded velocity to zero.

## Heartbeat Sequence Numbers and Replay Protection

Each frame carries a monotonically increasing heartbeat_seq integer per arm. A receiver that observes a non-monotonic heartbeat_seq from any sibling arm treats it as a protocol violation, sets heartbeat_ok = 0, and initiates emergency-park.
