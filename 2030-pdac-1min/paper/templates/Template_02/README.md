# Robotic Surgery Engineering Manuscript Template

Single column LaTeX academic paper template focused on the
**Robotic Surgery Engineering** perspective for physical AI oncology trials. This
bundle compiles cleanly with `pdflatex` plus `bibtex` (recommended on
Overleaf) and ships as one of ten distinct templates under
`generative-ai/templates/` in the parent repository.

A blank single-line `Keywords` slot is rendered on page one immediately
under the abstract so authors fill in their own keywords without
disturbing layout. Selected section headings and the title block use a dark blue accent as a stylistic differentiator across the template family.

bibtex   main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex

Tested behavior: single column, no line numbers, no preprint header,
clickable DOI plus ORCID link, raggedright tables to prevent rivers.

## Inspiration

Inspired by leading CC BY templates such as the MDPI single column
article template (Overleaf) and other journal-style CC BY templates,
adapted into ten visually distinct variants without preprint editing
formatting and without line numbers in columns.
